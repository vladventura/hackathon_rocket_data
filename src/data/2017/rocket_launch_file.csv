The first orbital attempt for Simorgh. Iranian official sources state that the rocket has reached orbit. U.S. Strategic Command confirmed that no satellite deployed from the rocket as the rocket suffered a ""catastrophic failure"" shortly after liftoff. The U.S. Air Force's Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base reported that it had not detected any satellite released into low-Earth orbit by the Simorgh SLV. Finally, the United States, France, Germany and Britain have condemned Iran's test of a satellite-launching rocket.
