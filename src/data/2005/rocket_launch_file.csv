Visited 9P/Tempel. Impactor impacted comet to test composition, main probe subsequently reused for EPOXI mission to study extrasolar planets and conduct a flyby of comet 103P/Hartley. Stardust-NExT mission will fly past comet to inspect the crater caused by the impactor, as debris thrown up prevented Deep Impact from doing so.
